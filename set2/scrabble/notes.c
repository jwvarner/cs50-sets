/*
Notes while watching lecture:

Know your types, decide what type you want, and code accordingly
use functions
when you clearly define the problem and what the solution ought to look like 
    you've done the majority of the work
use the debuggger to step through your code
Verbing N units == use a function

***Note while coding, I found a C text book and reference the types and handling of those types when in doubt
*///Prompt user
    //take prompt
    //promt user

        what do I not know how to do?
            convert prompt
        what should be a function?
            prompt user -- output: stored prompt, string
            convert prompt -- output: converted prompt as integer
            compare prompts -- output: result, string
